# Workstation Housekeeping v1.5

Scripts to manage data on the NGS workstation

## backup_runfolder.py

Uploads an Illumina runfolder to DNANexus.

### Usage

```bash
backup_runfolder.py [-h] -i RUNFOLDER [-a AUTH_TOKEN] [--ignore IGNORE] [-p PROJECT] [--logpath LOGPATH]
```

### What are the dependencies for this script?

This tool requires the DNAnexus utilities `ua` (upload agent) and `dx` (DNAnexus toolkit) to be available in the system PATH. Python3 is required, and this tool uses packages from the standard library.

### How does this tool work?

* The script parses the input parameters, asserting that the given runfolder exists.
* If the `-p` option is given, the script attempts to find a matching DNAnexus project. Otherwise, it looks for a single project matching the runfolder name. If more or less than 1 project matches, the script logs an error and exits.
* The runfolder is traversed and a list of files in each folder is obtained. If any comma-separated strings passed to the `--ignore` argument are present within the filepath, or filename the file is excluded.

* The DNAnexus `ua` utility is used to upload files in batches of 100 at a time. The number of upload tries is set to 100 with the `--tries` flag.
* Orthogonal tests are performed to:
    * A count of files that should be uploaded (using the ignore terms if provided)
    * A count of files in the DNA Nexus project
    * (If relevant) A count of files in the DNA Nexus project containing a pattern to be ignored. NB this may not be accurate if the ignore term is found in the result of dx find data (eg present in project name)
* Logs from this and the script are written to a logfile, named after the runfolder. A destination for this file can be passed to the `--logpath` flag.
